<objective>
Audit the next 6 skills: progress, quick-plan, phase-feedback, brainstorm, add-security-findings, and cst-help.

Purpose: These utility and auxiliary skills support the core pipeline. They have more varied configurations (haiku models, context forking, Skill tool usage) making them likely to surface more frontmatter gaps and classification edge cases.
Output: 6 additional audit entries appended to `02-AUDIT.md`

  Read the existing 02-AUDIT.md to understand the established format and any patterns from Plan 01's findings. Then perform the full review sequence (A through H from Plan 01 Task 2) for each skill, one at a time.

  **Skills to review (in this order):**

  ### Skill 7: progress

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - `context: fork` + haiku -- good lightweight pattern
  - No AskUserQuestion in allowed-tools
  - Read-only skill that analyzes state and recommends next action

  Key questions to investigate:
  - Is this the model pattern for read-only status skills? Should other similar skills copy this config?
  - No `argument-hint` -- does it accept arguments? Should it?
  - No `disable-model-invocation` -- is auto-invoke desirable here? ("What's next?" should auto-trigger this)
  - Is haiku appropriate or does the routing logic need more reasoning?
  - Tool list is `Read, Bash, Grep, Glob` -- no Write, no AskUserQuestion. Is this intentionally minimal?

  ### Skill 8: quick-plan

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - Includes Edit tool (unique among skills)
  - Spawns planner agent
  - Modifies ROADMAP.md directly

  Key questions to investigate:
  - Why does it need Edit tool? Is this for ROADMAP.md annotation?
  - Does it need blanket Bash or could it restrict?
  - Should it have `disable-model-invocation: true`? (Modifies roadmap -- should be intentional)
  - It spawns a planner -- does it embed the planner prompt or use a supporting file?
  - How does its planner differ from plan-phase's planner?

  ### Skill 9: phase-feedback

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - Two paths: quick fix (direct) and standard (spawns planner)
  - Uses Task and TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList tools

  Key questions to investigate:
  - Does the quick fix path need all the Task management tools?
  - Should the two paths be separate skills or is the routing logic clean?
  - Is the tool list appropriate for both paths or bloated for the quick fix path?
  - Does it need `disable-model-invocation: true`?
  - Does the description clearly differentiate it from quick-plan?

  Continue the full review sequence for each skill, one at a time.

  **Skills to review (in this order):**

  ### Skill 10: brainstorm

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - Uses Skill tool (unique -- invokes /create-roadmap)
  - Spawns 3 parallel agents in autonomous mode
  - Two modes: interactive and autonomous

  Key questions to investigate:
  - The Skill tool usage is significant -- does it invoke /create-roadmap correctly?
  - In autonomous mode, it spawns 3 agents -- are they properly configured with context?
  - Interactive mode uses AskUserQuestion -- does it work well in main context?
  - Is the description clear about the two modes?
  - Should `disable-model-invocation` be true? ("brainstorm" is a common word Claude might match too eagerly)
  - No `model` override -- should autonomous mode use opus for the parallel agents?

  ### Skill 11: add-security-findings

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - `disable-model-invocation: true` -- correctly set
  - Uses Skill tool to invoke /create-roadmap
  - Includes Edit in allowed-tools

  Key questions to investigate:
  - `disable-model-invocation: true` is good -- this is a specialized skill
  - Does it need Edit, or could it use Write only?
  - The Skill tool dependency on /create-roadmap -- is this clean delegation or tight coupling?
  - No `model` override -- should it have one?
  - No `argument-hint` -- does it accept arguments?
  - Missing `context` field -- should it fork?

  ### Skill 12: cst-help

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - haiku model -- lightweight help skill
  - No `context: fork` despite being read-only
  - References files in skills/ directory

  Key questions to investigate:
  - RESEARCH.md specifically identified missing `context: fork` -- should it fork like progress does?
  - Both cst-help and progress are read-only + haiku -- should they have identical configs?
  - Does it need AskUserQuestion? The help system asks clarifying questions
  - Does it read skill files at runtime? If so, that burns context -- fork would help
  - No `argument-hint` despite accepting questions -- should it have one?
  - Is haiku sufficient for help routing or does it struggle with complex questions?

  **Append each completed audit entry to 02-AUDIT.md** using the established format.

1. 02-AUDIT.md contains exactly 12 skill audit entries after this plan completes
2. Skills are in the correct order: new-project, create-roadmap, discuss-phase, research-phase, plan-phase, execute-phase, progress, quick-plan, phase-feedback, brainstorm, add-security-findings, cst-help
3. Every entry has all fields: frontmatter table, behavior summary, 6-dimension audit, capability gaps, recommendation, rationale, user decision
4. Cross-skill consistency observations are noted (e.g., "progress uses haiku+fork but cst-help uses haiku without fork -- inconsistent")
5. No "User Decision" fields are blank
</verification>

<success_criteria>
All 12 skills in the claude-super-team plugin are fully audited with user-approved classifications. Utility and auxiliary skills have been compared against the core pipeline patterns established in Plan 01.
