<objective>
Create the core /build SKILL.md -- the autonomous orchestrator that chains all claude-super-team skills from idea to working application without user intervention.

Purpose: This is the primary deliverable of Phase 8. It is the largest and most complex skill in the project (~600-900 lines). It must implement every locked decision from CONTEXT.md, leverage the foundation files from Plans 01 and 02, and follow established skill patterns from the codebase.

Output: A single `SKILL.md` file that is the complete /build skill.

  <action>
Create `plugins/claude-super-team/skills/build/SKILL.md`. This is a large file (~600-900 lines). Build it with all sections described below.

**YAML FRONTMATTER**

The frontmatter must include:

```yaml
---
name: build
description: "Autonomously build an entire application from idea to working code. Chains all claude-super-team skills (/new-project, /brainstorm, /create-roadmap, per-phase discuss/research/plan/execute) with zero user intervention. Maintains BUILD-STATE.md for compaction resilience and auto-resume. Makes autonomous decisions at every checkpoint using LLM reasoning and build preferences. Manages git branches per phase with squash-merge to main. Self-validates with bounded retry loops."
argument-hint: "<project idea OR path to PRD file>"
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Skill, AskUserQuestion, Bash(git *), Bash(mkdir *), Bash(ls *), Bash(test *), Bash(npm *), Bash(npx *), Bash(bun *), Bash(pnpm *), Bash(yarn *), Bash(cargo *), Bash(go *), Bash(make *), Bash(python *), Bash(pytest *), Bash(find *), Bash(grep *), Bash(cat *), Bash(bash *gather-data.sh), Bash(chmod *)
hooks:
  PreCompact:
    - matcher: "auto"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: 'echo "BUILD STATE TO PRESERVE:"; cat .planning/BUILD-STATE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No build state found"'
  SessionStart:
    - matcher: "compact"
      hooks:

          command: '{ echo "=== BUILD STATE ==="; cat .planning/BUILD-STATE.md 2>/dev/null; echo "=== PROJECT ==="; cat .planning/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null; echo "=== ROADMAP ==="; cat .planning/ROADMAP.md 2>/dev/null; echo "=== STATE ==="; cat .planning/STATE.md 2>/dev/null; echo "=== BUILD PREFERENCES ==="; cat .planning/build-preferences.md 2>/dev/null; cat ~/.claude/build-preferences.md 2>/dev/null; }'
---
```

Note on allowed-tools: This is a SUPERSET of all tools used by all child skills plus /build's own needs. The Skill tool is critical -- it enables programmatic skill invocation. Build/test tools (npm, bun, cargo, go, make, python, pytest) are needed for validation. Git is needed for branch management. AskUserQuestion must be listed even though /build answers them autonomously (child skills use it).

**DYNAMIC CONTEXT INJECTION**

After the frontmatter closing `---`, add:

```markdown
<!-- Dynamic context injection: pre-load build state, preferences, git status -->
!`bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/build/gather-data.sh"`

<!-- Core planning files (if they exist -- they won't on first run) -->
!`cat .planning/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null`
!`cat .planning/ROADMAP.md 2>/dev/null`
!`cat .planning/STATE.md 2>/dev/null`
```

**AUTONOMOUS OPERATION PREAMBLE (CRITICAL)**

Immediately after dynamic context injection, before ANY process documentation, place a prominent autonomous operation block. This is the most critical part of the skill -- it must survive compaction and be re-injected:

```markdown
## AUTONOMOUS OPERATION -- CRITICAL INSTRUCTION

**YOU ARE RUNNING IN FULLY AUTONOMOUS MODE.**

This skill builds an entire application without user intervention. You MUST follow these rules at ALL times:

1. **NEVER present AskUserQuestion to the user.** When ANY skill (including child skills invoked via Skill tool) triggers AskUserQuestion, YOU answer it autonomously using the decision framework in `references/autonomous-decision-guide.md`. Select the best option, log the decision in BUILD-STATE.md, and continue.

2. **NEVER stop to ask the user for input.** Every decision point has a resolution path: preferences file, project context, prior decisions, or best-guess with low-confidence logging.

3. **NEVER abort the pipeline.** If a phase fails, mark it incomplete and continue to the next phase. If a skill errors, log the error and skip that step. The only valid stop condition is: all phases processed and final report generated.

4. **ALWAYS update BUILD-STATE.md before and after each skill invocation.** This is your recovery mechanism. If context compaction occurs, BUILD-STATE.md is re-injected and you resume from the last recorded position.

5. **After context compaction:** Read BUILD-STATE.md to determine current position. Read `references/autonomous-decision-guide.md` for decision framework. Resume from the `in_progress` stage in Pipeline Progress or Phase Progress.
```

**OBJECTIVE SECTION**

```markdown
## Objective

Build a complete application from a project idea or PRD to working, validated code -- fully autonomously.

**Pipeline:** Input detection -> /new-project -> [/map-codebase] -> /brainstorm -> /create-roadmap -> For each phase: [/discuss-phase] -> [/research-phase] -> /plan-phase -> /execute-phase -> [validate] -> [/phase-feedback] -> git merge -> Final validation -> [auto-fix] -> BUILD-REPORT.md

**Reads:** $ARGUMENTS (idea or file path), `~/.claude/build-preferences.md`, `.planning/build-preferences.md`, `.planning/BUILD-STATE.md` (for resume)
**Creates:** All `.planning/` artifacts, application source code, `.planning/BUILD-STATE.md`, `.planning/BUILD-REPORT.md`

**Key behaviors:**
- Invokes all skills via the Skill tool (same session, shared context)
- Makes autonomous decisions at every AskUserQuestion checkpoint
- Maintains BUILD-STATE.md for compaction resilience and auto-resume
- Creates feature branch per phase execution, squash-merges to main
- Adaptive pipeline depth: skips discuss/research for simple phases
- Adaptive validation: only validates code-producing phases (always validates final)
- One feedback attempt per failed phase, then skip and continue
- 3-attempt auto-fix loop on final build/test failure
```

**PROCESS SECTION**

Document each step of the pipeline. This is the bulk of the SKILL.md. Each step must specify exactly what to do, including the Skill tool invocation syntax.

### Step 1: Detect Resume vs Fresh Start

Check the pre-loaded BUILD_STATE section from gather-data.sh.

**If BUILD-STATE.md EXISTS and Status is `in_progress`:**
- This is a RESUME. Read BUILD-STATE.md fully.
- Determine current position from Pipeline Progress and Phase Progress tables.
- Find the first row with status `in_progress` -- that is where to resume.
- If a `build/*` branch exists (from gather-data.sh GIT section), handle resume:
  - Check if execution completed on that branch (SUMMARY.md files for all plans)
  - If yes: squash-merge and continue to next phase
  - If no: checkout the branch and resume execution
- Skip to the appropriate step below based on current position.
- Print: "Resuming build from {current_stage}. Compaction count: {N}."

**If BUILD-STATE.md does NOT exist or Status is `complete` or `failed`:**
- This is a FRESH START. Continue to Step 2.
- If a stale BUILD-STATE.md exists (status `complete` or `failed`), note it and start fresh.

### Step 2: Parse Input

Read $ARGUMENTS. Use the file path detection heuristic from `references/pipeline-guide.md`:

1. Split on whitespace
2. Check each token for file path indicators (starts with `/`, `./`, `~/`, `../`; ends with `.md`, `.txt`)
3. Verify each potential path exists: `test -f "$token"`
4. Result: `$IDEA_TEXT` (inline text), `$PRD_PATH` (file path, if any), `$PRD_CONTENT` (file contents, if path found)

If no $ARGUMENTS provided, this is an error:
```
ERROR: /build requires a project idea or path to a PRD file.
Usage: /build <project idea> or /build ./path/to/prd.md
```
Exit.

### Step 3: Load Preferences

Read build preferences from both locations (if they exist):
1. `~/.claude/build-preferences.md` (global) -- from gather-data.sh PREFERENCES section
2. `.planning/build-preferences.md` (project) -- from gather-data.sh PREFERENCES section

If project-level exists, it takes precedence for any overlapping fields. Merge into a unified preference context used throughout the build.

If neither exists, proceed with no preferences (LLM reasoning handles all decisions).

### Step 4: Initialize BUILD-STATE.md

Read the template from `assets/build-state-template.md`. Populate the Session section:
- Started: current timestamp
- Input: $IDEA_TEXT (or first line of $PRD_CONTENT)
- Input source: inline | file | both
- Status: in_progress
- Current stage: input-detection
- Current phase: N/A
- Git main branch: current branch from gather-data.sh (or "main")
- Compaction count: 0

Set Pipeline Progress "input-detection" row to `complete`.

Write to `.planning/BUILD-STATE.md`.

### Step 5: Invoke /new-project

Read `references/autonomous-decision-guide.md` for the autonomous decision framework. This will guide all AskUserQuestion handling throughout the build.

Update BUILD-STATE.md: set "new-project" to `in_progress`.

Invoke the skill:
```
Skill('new-project', '{$IDEA_TEXT or $PRD_CONTENT}')
```

The /new-project skill will ask several AskUserQuestion questions (brownfield detection, exploration depth, exec model). Answer ALL of them autonomously per the decision guide. Key decisions:
- If brownfield detected: answer "Skip mapping" for the brownfield question -- /new-project exits without creating PROJECT.md if "Map first" is selected. /build handles /map-codebase independently in Step 6 based on CODE_FILES count.
- Exploration questions: answer 2-3 rounds then select "Create PROJECT.md" to move forward
- Exec model: use build-preferences exec model, or default to opus

After /new-project completes, verify `.planning/PROJECT.md` exists. If not, log error and exit.

Update BUILD-STATE.md: set "new-project" to `complete`.

### Step 6: Invoke /map-codebase (Brownfield Only)

Check brownfield status from gather-data.sh: `CODE_FILES` value.

**If CODE_FILES > 0** (brownfield):
- Update BUILD-STATE.md: set "map-codebase" to `in_progress`
- Invoke: `Skill('map-codebase')`
- Wait for completion
- Update BUILD-STATE.md: set "map-codebase" to `complete`

**If CODE_FILES = 0** (greenfield):
- Update BUILD-STATE.md: set "map-codebase" to `skipped`, Notes: "Greenfield project"
- Continue

### Step 7: Invoke /brainstorm (Autonomous Mode)

Update BUILD-STATE.md: set "brainstorm" to `in_progress`.

Invoke: `Skill('brainstorm')`

When /brainstorm asks "Mode" -> select "Autonomous" (this is a locked decision).
When /brainstorm asks to review ideas -> select "Approve all".
When /brainstorm asks about roadmap -> select "Add to roadmap" / "Yes".

After completion, update BUILD-STATE.md: set "brainstorm" to `complete`, Notes: summary of ideas.

### Step 8: Invoke /create-roadmap

Update BUILD-STATE.md: set "create-roadmap" to `in_progress`.

Invoke: `Skill('create-roadmap')`

Answer any AskUserQuestion calls autonomously (roadmap structure, phase count, etc.). Accept the LLM's recommended roadmap structure.

After completion, verify `.planning/ROADMAP.md` exists. Read it to determine the list of phases.

Update BUILD-STATE.md:
- Set "create-roadmap" to `complete`
- Populate the Phase Progress table with one row per phase from ROADMAP.md (all columns `pending`)

### Step 9: Phase Execution Loop

For each phase N in ROADMAP.md (sequential):

**9a. Update BUILD-STATE.md:** Set current phase to N. Set current stage to `phase-{N}-pipeline`.

**9b. Adaptive Pipeline Depth Decision**

Read `references/pipeline-guide.md` section "Adaptive Pipeline Depth Heuristic". Analyze the phase goal and success criteria from ROADMAP.md.

Determine: FULL pipeline (discuss + research + plan + execute) or SIMPLE pipeline (plan + execute only).

Log the decision in BUILD-STATE.md Decisions Log: Phase N, Skill: "adaptive", Question: "Pipeline depth", Answer: "full/simple", Confidence: high/medium.

**9c. Invoke /discuss-phase N (Full Pipeline Only)**

If FULL pipeline:
- Update Phase Progress: set Discuss to `in_progress`
- Invoke: `Skill('discuss-phase', '{N}')`
- Answer all gray area questions autonomously using project context, preferences, and the decision guide
- Key: after answering all presented gray areas, select "All set" / "Done discussing" to move forward (do not loop)
- Update Phase Progress: set Discuss to `complete`

If SIMPLE pipeline:
- Update Phase Progress: set Discuss to `skipped`

**9d. Invoke /research-phase N (Full Pipeline Only)**

If FULL pipeline:
- Update Phase Progress: set Research to `in_progress`
- Invoke: `Skill('research-phase', '{N}')`
- Answer any AskUserQuestion calls autonomously
- If conflicts with CONTEXT.md: keep CONTEXT.md decisions (they are locked)
- Update Phase Progress: set Research to `complete`

If SIMPLE pipeline:
- Update Phase Progress: set Research to `skipped`

**9e. Invoke /plan-phase N**

Update Phase Progress: set Plan to `in_progress`.

Invoke: `Skill('plan-phase', '{N}')`

Answer any AskUserQuestion calls autonomously:
- Plan verification: always verify
- Revision: accept plans unless critical issues found (one revision max)

Update Phase Progress: set Plan to `complete`.

**9f. Git: Commit Planning Artifacts and Create Feature Branch**

On main branch, commit planning artifacts:
```bash
git add .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/ .planning/STATE.md .planning/ROADMAP.md .planning/BUILD-STATE.md
git commit -m "[build] Plan phase {N}: {phase_name}"
```

Create feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b build/{NN}-{slug}
```
Where `{NN}` is zero-padded phase number and `{slug}` is phase name slug from directory.

Update Phase Progress: set Git Merge to `branched`.

**9g. Invoke /execute-phase N**

Update Phase Progress: set Execute to `in_progress`.

Invoke: `Skill('execute-phase', '{N}')`

Answer all AskUserQuestion calls autonomously:
- Branch warning (on build/ branch, not main): "Continue anyway"
- Exec model: use resolved preference
- Task blocked: "Skip task"
- Checkpoints: auto-approve, log low confidence
- Verification gaps: "Accept as-is" (do NOT trigger execute-phase's internal gap closure -- rely on the external build/test validation in Step 9h to catch real failures, and /phase-feedback in Step 9i for the single permitted feedback attempt)

After completion, commit execution results:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "[build] Execute phase {N}: {phase_name}"
```

Update Phase Progress: set Execute to `complete`.

**9h. Adaptive Validation**

Read `references/pipeline-guide.md` section "Adaptive Validation Heuristic".

Determine if validation should run for this phase. Check:
- Did the phase produce source code? (check SUMMARY.md files_created for code files)
- Does a build system exist? (package.json, Makefile, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Is this the final phase? (always validate)

**If VALIDATE:**
- Update Phase Progress: set Validate to `in_progress`
- Detect build/test commands (priority order from pipeline-guide.md)
- Run build command via Bash. Capture output.
- Run test command via Bash. Capture output.
- Record results in BUILD-STATE.md Validation Results table
- If pass: Update Phase Progress: set Validate to `complete` (pass)
- If fail: proceed to 9i

**If SKIP:**
- Update Phase Progress: set Validate to `skipped`
- Update Validation Results: mark as skipped

**9i. Phase Feedback (One Attempt, On Validation Failure)**

If validation failed in 9h:

1. Synthesize feedback from build/test error output
2. Update Phase Progress: set Feedback to `in_progress`
3. Invoke: `Skill('phase-feedback', '{N} {synthesized_error_description}')`
4. Answer any AskUserQuestion calls autonomously
5. If /phase-feedback creates a subphase (e.g., N.1):
   - Invoke: `Skill('execute-phase', '{N.1}')`
   - Answer AskUserQuestion calls autonomously
6. Re-run validation (same commands as 9h)
7. If pass: Update Phase Progress: set Feedback to `complete`, Validate to `complete` (pass after feedback)
8. If still fail: Update Phase Progress: set Feedback to `failed`
   - Log in Incomplete Phases section: "Phase {N}: validation failed after feedback attempt. Errors: {summary}"
   - Continue to next phase (locked decision: skip and continue)

If validation passed or was skipped in 9h:
- Update Phase Progress: set Feedback to `N/A`

**9j. Git: Squash-Merge to Main**

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --squash build/{NN}-{slug}
git commit -m "[build] Phase {N}: {phase_name}

{1-2 sentence summary from SUMMARY.md}

Validation: {pass|fail|skipped}
Plans executed: {M}/{total}

Autonomous build by /build skill."
git branch -d build/{NN}-{slug}
```

If merge fails (unlikely since /build is the only committer):
- Log error in BUILD-STATE.md Errors section
- Stay on main, delete the feature branch: `git branch -D build/{NN}-{slug}`
- Continue to next phase

Update Phase Progress: set Git Merge to `complete`, Status to `complete` (or `incomplete` if validation failed).

**9k. Update BUILD-STATE.md**

Write the full updated BUILD-STATE.md. This is the recovery point for the next phase or for compaction resume.

### Step 10: Final Validation

After all phases complete:

1. Ensure we are on main branch
2. ALWAYS run build + test validation (regardless of adaptive heuristic)
3. Detect validation commands (same detection as 9h)
4. Run build. Run tests. Record results.

**If pass:** Proceed to Step 12.

**If fail:** Proceed to Step 11 (auto-fix).

### Step 11: Auto-Fix Loop (Max 3 Attempts)

Locked decision: 3-attempt auto-fix on final failure.

For attempt 1 to 3:
1. Read build/test error output
2. Analyze the errors: identify the failing files, error messages, likely causes
3. Apply fixes using Edit/Write tools directly (no skill invocation -- direct code fixes)
4. Re-run build + tests
5. If pass: log success, break loop
6. If fail: log attempt in BUILD-STATE.md Errors section, continue to next attempt

After 3 failures:
- Log final errors in BUILD-STATE.md
- Set build status to `partial`
- Continue to Step 12 (report generation)

### Step 12: Generate BUILD-REPORT.md

Read `assets/build-report-template.md`. Populate all sections from BUILD-STATE.md:

- Overview: project name, input, timestamps, status
- Pipeline Summary: phase counts, plan counts, feedback loops, compactions
- Phase Results: from Phase Progress table
- Key Decisions: from Decisions Log (full list)
- Low-Confidence Decisions: filtered subset with confidence = low (highlighted for user review)
- Validation Summary: from Validation Results table
- Final Validation: build/test results and auto-fix attempts
- Incomplete Items: from Incomplete Phases section
- Known Issues: from Errors section
- Files Created: summary from SUMMARY.md files
- Next Steps: recommendations based on outcome

Write to `.planning/BUILD-REPORT.md`.

Update BUILD-STATE.md: set Status to `complete` (or `partial` or `failed`).

### Step 13: Present Completion Summary

Print a final summary:

```
Build complete.

Project: {name}
Status: {complete|partial|failed}
Phases: {completed}/{total} ({incomplete} incomplete)
Validation: {final validation result}

Low-confidence decisions: {count} (review in BUILD-REPORT.md)
Incomplete phases: {list or "none"}

Full report: .planning/BUILD-REPORT.md
Build state: .planning/BUILD-STATE.md

---

Next steps:

If build is complete:
- Review low-confidence decisions in BUILD-REPORT.md
- Test the application manually
- Run /phase-feedback to iterate on any phase

If build has incomplete phases:
- Review incomplete phases in BUILD-REPORT.md
- Fix manually or run /phase-feedback {N} for each incomplete phase
- Re-run /build to attempt remaining work

Git: All changes are committed locally. Review with:
  git log --oneline

Push when ready (never done automatically):
  git push origin main
```

**END OF PROCESS**

The SKILL.md should be written as a single coherent document. All steps above become `### Step N: Title` sections in the Process. The total file should be 600-900 lines, consistent with execute-phase (711 lines) as the current largest skill.
