<objective>
Integrate the /build skill into the project ecosystem: update the help system (/cst-help), bump plugin version, sync marketplace, update changelog, and update project documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md).

Purpose: The /build skill is not fully integrated until the help system knows about it, the version is bumped, and all documentation reflects the new capability. This is the standard integration step performed after every new skill addition.

Output: Updated help files, version bump, marketplace sync, changelog entry, and documentation updates.

Update three files in the /cst-help skill to document the new /build skill:

**1. SKILL.md** -- Update the "Skill Reference" output section

Find the skill reference listing in the cst-help SKILL.md. Add /build to the list in the appropriate position. The entry should be:

```
/build [idea or PRD path] -- Autonomously build entire application from idea to working code. Chains all skills with zero user intervention. Manages git branches, validates output, auto-fixes failures. Creates BUILD-STATE.md for compaction resilience and auto-resume. Use for greenfield projects or when you want full pipeline automation.
```

Place it after the existing Ad-Hoc Extensions section or in a new "Full Automation" section if that reads better.

**2. workflow-guide.md** -- Update pipeline overview

Read the current workflow-guide.md. Add /build to the pipeline documentation. Create a new section "Full Automation" (or similar) in the guide:

```markdown
### Full Automation

```
/build [idea or PRD]  -> Autonomously chains entire pipeline from idea to working application
                         Runs: /new-постproject -> [/map-codebase] -> /brainstorm -> /create-roadmap
                         Then per phase: [/discuss-phase] -> [/research-phase] -> /plan-phase -> /execute-phase
                         Creates .planning/BUILD-STATE.md (compaction resilience, auto-resume)
                         Creates .planning/BUILD-REPORT.md (final summary with decisions and validation)
                         Manages git branches per phase (build/{NN}-{slug}), squash-merges to main
                         Supports: build-preferences.md for tech stack and style preferences
```
```

Also update the "Key Concepts" section to mention BUILD-STATE.md and build-preferences.md as new artifacts.

Update the "File Structure Reference" if one exists to include:
- `.planning/BUILD-STATE.md` -- Build pipeline state and recovery
- `.planning/BUILD-REPORT.md` -- Final build summary
- `~/.claude/build-preferences.md` -- Global build preferences
- `.planning/build-preferences.md` -- Per-project build preferences

**3. troubleshooting.md** -- Add /build troubleshooting entries

Add a new "Build Automation" section with these entries:

#### "/build stopped or seems stuck"

**Symptom:** /build appears to hang or stop making progress

**Cause:** Context compaction may have occurred, or a child skill is waiting for AskUserQuestion

**Solution:**
- Check `.planning/BUILD-STATE.md` for current position
- Re-invoke `/build` -- it will auto-resume from BUILD-STATE.md
- If BUILD-STATE.md shows `in_progress` for a stage, that stage will be re-executed

#### "BUILD-STATE.md shows incomplete phases"

**Symptom:** Build completed but some phases are marked incomplete

**Cause:** Validation failed and feedback attempt did not resolve the issues

**Solution:**
- Review `.planning/BUILD-REPORT.md` for details on failures
- Run `/phase-feedback {N}` manually for each incomplete phase
- Or fix issues manually and re-run validation

#### "Build preferences not being used"

**Symptom:** /build makes decisions that contradict your preferences

**Cause:** Preferences file not found or not in expected location

**Solution:**
- Global: `~/.claude/build-preferences.md`
- Per-project: `.planning/build-preferences.md`
- Check file exists and sections match expected format
- Project-level overrides global for overlapping fields

#### "Git branch conflicts during squash-merge"

**Symptom:** /build logs a merge error

**Cause:** Unexpected changes on main during build

**Solution:**
- /build operates locally and is the only committer, so this is rare
- Check `git status` and resolve manually
- Re-invoke `/build` to resume

Also update the "When to Use Each Skill" section to include /build:
- **Want full automation from idea to code:** `/build`
- **Want step-by-step control:** Use individual skills (/new-project, /create-roadmap, etc.)

Perform the standard release integration for adding a new skill:

**1. plugin.json -- Bump version and update description**

Read `plugins/claude-super-team/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Bump the version from `1.0.17` to `1.0.18`. Update the description to mention the /build skill:

Add "autonomous full-pipeline build automation" or similar phrase to the description string. Keep the description concise -- it is already long.

**2. marketplace.json -- Sync version and description**

Read `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Update the claude-super-team entry:
- Version: `1.0.18` (match plugin.json)
- Description: match the updated description from plugin.json

**3. CHANGELOG.md -- Add entry**

Read `CHANGELOG.md`. Add a new entry at the top following the existing format:

```markdown
## [1.0.18] - 2026-02-18

### claude-super-team
- Added `/build` skill for autonomous full-pipeline application building from idea to working code
- Chains all 14 claude-super-team skills via Skill tool with zero user intervention
- Maintains BUILD-STATE.md for compaction resilience and auto-resume across context compactions
- Adaptive pipeline depth: LLM decides per-phase whether to run discuss/research or skip to plan/execute
- Git autonomy: feature branch per phase execution, squash-merge to main, never pushes
- Adaptive validation with bounded auto-fix (3 attempts) on final build/test failure
- One feedback attempt per failed phase, then mark incomplete and continue
- build-preferences.md support (global ~/.claude/ and per-project .planning/) for tech stack and style preferences
- BUILD-REPORT.md generated at completion with full decisions log and low-confidence decision highlights
- Updated /cst-help with /build documentation, troubleshooting entries, and workflow guide updates
```

**4. CLAUDE.md -- Update Core Workflow section**

Read `CLAUDE.md`. Find the "Core Workflow (claude-super-team plugin)" section with the skills pipeline listing. Add /build to the listing:

```
/build [idea or PRD]  --> .planning/BUILD-STATE.md + BUILD-REPORT.md (autonomous full pipeline, chains all skills)
```

Add it in a logical position -- either at the top (as the "one command to rule them all") or in a separate "Full Automation" subsection. Also update the skill count if mentioned (14 skills -> 15 skills).

**5. README.md -- Update to mention /build**

Read `README.md`. Add /build to the skill listing and any overview sections. The /build skill is the headline feature for this version -- it should be prominently mentioned as the fully autonomous build capability.

**6. ROADMAP.md -- Fix stale "target directory" verbiage in Phase 8 Success Criterion**

Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md`. Find Phase 8 Success Criterion 1 which mentions "and optional target directory". Remove the "and optional target directory" text to align the roadmap with the CONTEXT.md deferred decision (target directory was deferred).

**7. marketplace.json -- Bump top-level version**

Also bump the top-level `version` field in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from `1.0.17` to `1.0.18` (in addition to the per-plugin version updated in step 2 above).

For all file edits, use the Edit tool to make targeted changes rather than rewriting entire files.
