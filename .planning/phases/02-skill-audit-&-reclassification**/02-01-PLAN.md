<objective>
Audit the first 6 skills in the core sequential pipeline: new-project, create-roadmap, discuss-phase, research-phase, plan-phase, and execute-phase.

Purpose: These are the backbone of the planning workflow. Auditing them first establishes the pattern and catches the highest-impact gaps earliest.
Output: `.planning/phases/02-skill-audit-&-reclassification**/02-AUDIT.md` (created with header + first 6 skill entries)

  <name>Task 1: Create audit document and load reference material</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/02-skill-audit-&-reclassification**/02-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
  1. Read `CAPABILITY-REFERENCE.md` fully -- this is the audit baseline. Pay special attention to:
     - Section 1 (Skills): All 13 frontmatter fields and their statuses
     - Section 2 (Agents): Built-in agent types and invocation methods
     - The "Documented but unused" items -- these are adoption opportunities

  2. Read the Phase 2 RESEARCH.md for:
     - Classification criteria (Remain / Convert to Agent / Hybrid / Needs Feature Additions)
     - Frontmatter completeness checklist (6 dimensions)
     - Per-skill pre-audit findings table

  3. Create `02-AUDIT.md` with this header structure:

  ```markdown
  # Phase 2: Skill Audit & Reclassification

  **Date:** {today's date}
  **Auditor:** Claude (with user classification decisions)
  **Reference:** CAPABILITY-REFERENCE.md (2026-02-11)
  **Total items:** 17 skills + 1 agent across 3 plugins

  ## Classification Criteria

  | Classification | When to Use |
  |---------------|-------------|
  | Remain as Skill | Runs in main context, orchestrates agents, interactive flow, works well |
  | Convert to Agent | Self-contained, needs tool restrictions, benefits from context isolation, no user interaction |
  | Hybrid (Skill + Agent) | Has both interactive AND autonomous phases |
  | Needs Feature Additions | Missing frontmatter, could leverage unused capabilities, incorrect config |

  ## Frontmatter Checklist (6 Dimensions)

  1. **Tool Restrictions** (allowed-tools): Present? Minimal? Bash-specific patterns?
  2. **Model Selection** (model): Appropriate? Consistent with similar skills?
  3. **Context Mode** (context): Fork needed? Fork harmful?
  4. **Invocation Control** (disable-model-invocation, user-invocable): Auto-invoke appropriate?
  5. **Description Quality** (description): Clear? Concise? Differentiating?
  6. **Argument Handling** (argument-hint): Present? Accurate?

  For EACH of the 3 skills below, perform this review sequence ONE AT A TIME:

  **Review sequence per skill:**

  A. **Read the full SKILL.md** -- not just frontmatter, the entire skill body. Understand what it does, how it works, what tools it actually uses in practice.

  B. **Build the current frontmatter table:**
     | Field | Value |
     |-------|-------|
     | name | {value} |
     | description | {value or "not set"} |
     | allowed-tools | {value or "not set"} |
     | model | {value or "not set (inherits)"} |
     | context | {value or "not set (default: skill)"} |
     | disable-model-invocation | {value or "not set (default: false)"} |
     | argument-hint | {value or "not set"} |
     | user-invocable | {value or "not set (default: true)"} |

  C. **Write a 1-2 sentence behavior summary** describing what the skill does and how (interactive? spawns agents? reads/writes what files?).

  D. **Run the 6-dimension frontmatter audit.** For each dimension, assess GAP or OK:
     1. Tool Restrictions: Is `allowed-tools` present? Is it minimal (principle of least privilege)? Does it use Bash-specific patterns like `Bash(gh *)` where appropriate, or blanket `Bash`?
     2. Model Selection: Is `model` set? Should it be? Is it consistent with similar skills?
     3. Context Mode: Is `context: fork` set? Should it be? Would forking help or hurt this skill?
     4. Invocation Control: Is `disable-model-invocation` set correctly? Should this skill be auto-invocable?
     5. Description Quality: Is the description clear, concise, and differentiating? Does it help Claude decide when to auto-invoke?
     6. Argument Handling: Is `argument-hint` present? Is it accurate?

  E. **Identify capability gaps** beyond frontmatter -- things like:
     - Could benefit from dynamic context injection (`!`command``)
     - Missing supporting files that could be extracted
     - Cross-skill consistency issues (model/tool choices differ from similar skills without reason)

  F. **State classification recommendation** with rationale, referencing the criteria from RESEARCH.md.

  G. **Present findings to user** using AskUserQuestion with these choices:
     - Remain as Skill
     - Convert to Agent
     - Hybrid (Skill + Agent)
     - Needs Feature Additions
     - Needs Feature Additions + Remain as Skill (both apply)

     Include a summary of key findings and your recommendation in the question text.

  H. **Record the user's decision** in the audit document entry.

  **Skills to review (in this order):**

  ### Skill 1: new-project

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - No model override (inherits default)
  - Blanket Bash access
  - No hooks
  - Interactive, user-facing skill

  Key questions to investigate:
  - Does it need blanket Bash or could it use specific patterns?
  - Should it have `disable-model-invocation: true`? (It checks for existing PROJECT.md, so auto-invoke could be confusing)
  - Missing `argument-hint` despite accepting arguments

  ### Skill 2: create-roadmap

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - `disable-model-invocation: false` explicitly set (redundant since false is the default)
  - Blanket Bash access
  - Accepts arguments for modification intent

  Key questions to investigate:
  - Is the redundant `disable-model-invocation: false` harmful or just noise?
  - Does it need blanket Bash or could it use specific patterns?
  - Is description quality sufficient for auto-invocation (it's a long description)?

  ### Skill 3: discuss-phase

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - Uses Task for Explore agent
  - Blanket Bash access
  - Complex multi-phase process with user interaction

  Key questions to investigate:
  - Does it actually use Task tool? If so, it's an orchestrator pattern
  - Could it benefit from `context: fork` for the exploration phase?
  - Should it restrict Bash patterns?

  **Append each completed audit entry to 02-AUDIT.md** using the format from RESEARCH.md:

  ```markdown
  ### Skill: {name} (claude-super-team)

  **Current Frontmatter:**
  | Field | Value |
  |-------|-------|
  | ... | ... |

  **Behavior Summary:** {1-2 sentences}

  **Frontmatter Audit:**
  | Check | Status | Finding |
  |-------|--------|---------|
  | allowed-tools completeness | GAP / OK | {details} |
  | model selection | GAP / OK | {details} |
  | context mode | GAP / OK | {details} |
  | argument-hint | GAP / OK | {details} |
  | disable-model-invocation | GAP / OK | {details} |
  | description quality | GAP / OK | {details} |

  **Capability Gap Analysis:**
  - {gap 1}
  - {gap 2}

  **Classification Recommendation:** {recommendation}
  **Rationale:** {why}

  **User Decision:** {user's choice}

  <action>
  Follow the SAME review sequence (A through H) from Task 2 for each of these 3 skills, one at a time.

  **Skills to review (in this order):**

  ### Skill 4: research-phase

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - Spawns custom phase-researcher agent
  - Clean orchestrator pattern
  - Already uses agent delegation well

  Key questions to investigate:
  - Is the orchestrator lean enough? Does it burn unnecessary context before spawning the agent?
  - Does it pass all necessary context to the agent or force the agent to re-read files?
  - Are tool restrictions appropriate for an orchestrator (it reads files then spawns agent)?

  ### Skill 5: plan-phase

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - Spawns planner + checker agents
  - Complex `--all` mode for batch planning
  - Blanket Bash access

  Key questions to investigate:
  - Does the `--all` mode work reliably or is it a context pressure risk?
  - Should it have `disable-model-invocation: true`? (Complex skill that shouldn't auto-trigger)
  - Are the planner/checker agent prompts embedded inline or in supporting files?
  - Does it properly pass CONTEXT.md and RESEARCH.md to the planner agent?

  ### Skill 6: execute-phase

  Pre-audit notes from RESEARCH.md:
  - Most complex skill in the marketplace
  - Agent teams support (--team flag)
  - Task management tools (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, etc.)
  - Blanket Bash access

  Key questions to investigate:
  - Given its complexity, is it too large for a single skill? Should any part be extracted to an agent?
  - Does it correctly use the wide tool list (TaskCreate, TeamCreate, SendMessage, etc.)?
  - The `--team` flag triggers experimental agent teams -- is this properly gated?
  - Does the code-simplifier step work correctly? How is it invoked?
  - Should it have `disable-model-invocation: true`? (Complex, destructive -- should never auto-trigger)
