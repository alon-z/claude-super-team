# Phase 1.1 Plan 01: Progress Pipeline Steps Summary

Enhanced the `/progress` skill's phase table to show per-phase pipeline step status (discuss/research/plan) derived from CONTEXT.md, RESEARCH.md, and PLAN.md file presence.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files | Status |
|---|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Add pipeline step detection to Phase 5 and enhance phase table in Phase 6 | d4640bf | plugins/claude-super-team/skills/progress/SKILL.md | complete |

## What Was Built

- **Phase 5 (Build Phase Map):** Added explicit `HAS_CONTEXT`, `HAS_RESEARCH`, and `HAS_PLANS` detection per phase directory
- **Phase 6 (Present Status Report):** Added "Steps" column to the phase table showing `D R P` indicators (D=discuss, R=research, P=plan, `·`=not done, `- - -`=phase complete)
- **Phase 6 legend:** Added explanatory legend for the step indicators below the status indicator list
