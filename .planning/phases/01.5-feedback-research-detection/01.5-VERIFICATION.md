# Phase 01.5 Verification: Feedback Research Detection

## Must-Haves

1. Research detection step uses LLM analysis of confirmed feedback (after Step 4d) to produce yes/no signal with explanation
2. Phase-researcher custom agent spawned inline via Task tool using same pattern as research-phase SKILL.md
3. RESEARCH.md written to feedback subphase directory and content embedded in planner prompt
4. Quick Fix Path (Step 6) is NOT modified

## Artifact Verification

### plugins/claude-super-team/skills/phase-feedback/SKILL.md

**Level 1 -- Existence:** EXISTS (441 lines)
**Level 2 -- Substantive:** SUBSTANTIVE -- full implementation with research detection (Step 10), researcher spawning (Step 11), and planner prompt with research content (Step 12)
**Level 3 -- Wired:** WIRED -- Steps 10-11-12-13 form a connected flow; research output feeds into planner prompt

### plugins/claude-super-team/skills/phase-feedback/references/planner-feedback-mode.md

**Level 1 -- Existence:** EXISTS (91 lines)
**Level 2 -- Substantive:** SUBSTANTIVE -- references RESEARCH.md as optional input in comparison table (line 12) and Understanding Parent Context section (line 37)
**Level 3 -- Wired:** WIRED -- planner guide documents RESEARCH.md as optional context, aligning with conditional research flow in SKILL.md

| Link | Status |
|------|--------|
| Step 10 (Detect Research Need) follows Step 9 (Annotate ROADMAP.md) | WIRED |
| Step 11 spawns phase-researcher with `subagent_type: "phase-researcher"` | WIRED |
| Step 12 planner prompt includes conditional `${RESEARCH_CONTENT}` section | WIRED |
| planner-feedback-mode.md references RESEARCH.md in table and context section | WIRED |

## Observable Truths

### 1. Research detection uses LLM analysis after confirmed feedback
**Status:** VERIFIED

Step 10 (lines 251-269) analyzes `$FEEDBACK` and `$EXECUTION_CONTEXT` against three criteria: unfamiliar packages/libraries/APIs, external services/protocols, and architectural patterns not in existing code. Produces `$RESEARCH_NEEDED` (yes/no) and `$RESEARCH_TOPICS`. Explicitly stated as "autonomous LLM decision" with no user confirmation.

### 2. Phase-researcher spawned with correct pattern
**Status:** VERIFIED

Step 11 (lines 271-311) spawns via `Task(subagent_type: "phase-researcher")` matching the research-phase SKILL.md pattern (line 129 of research-phase). Passes PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, STACK.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, feedback as goal, and research topics. Writes RESEARCH.md to `${PHASE_DIR}/${FEEDBACK_PHASE_PADDED}-RESEARCH.md`. Handles RESEARCH BLOCKED gracefully.

### 3. RESEARCH.md content embedded in planner prompt
**Status:** VERIFIED

Step 12 (lines 312-376) includes `${RESEARCH_CONTENT}` in the planner Task prompt (line 353-355) with a conditional note: "Include this section only if $RESEARCH_CONTENT is non-empty." Research content stored after researcher returns (line 308).

### 4. Quick Fix Path (Step 6) unchanged
**Status:** VERIFIED

Step 6 (lines 157-191) contains only: locate target files, apply changes, verify changes, present completion summary. No research detection, no agent spawning. Ends with "STOP here -- do not continue to Step 7."

### 5. Step numbering sequential with no gaps
**Status:** VERIFIED

Steps: 1, 2, 3, 4 (4a-4d), 5 (5a-5b), 6 (6a-6d), 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Sequential, no gaps.

## Anti-Pattern Scan

| Pattern | Found | Severity |
|---------|-------|----------|
| TODO/FIXME | No | -- |
| Placeholder content | No | -- |
| Empty implementations | No | -- |
| Stub patterns | No | -- |

## Result

**Status: passed**

All four must-haves verified. Research detection is properly positioned after feedback confirmation (Step 4d) and before planning (Step 12). The phase-researcher spawning pattern matches research-phase SKILL.md. RESEARCH.md content conditionally flows into the planner prompt. Quick Fix Path is untouched.
