# Phase 01.5 Plan 01: Feedback Research Detection Summary

Added inline research detection to phase-feedback so feedback involving unfamiliar packages, APIs, or patterns automatically triggers the phase-researcher agent before planning.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files | Status |
|---|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Add research detection and researcher spawning steps to phase-feedback SKILL.md | f70d05e | plugins/claude-super-team/skills/phase-feedback/SKILL.md | complete |
| 2 | Update planner-feedback-mode.md to document research input | 4e98e28 | plugins/claude-super-team/skills/phase-feedback/references/planner-feedback-mode.md | complete |

## What Was Built

- **Step 10 (Detect Research Need):** An autonomous LLM analysis step that examines confirmed feedback against the execution context to determine if research is needed. Checks for unfamiliar packages, external service integrations, and novel architectural patterns. Produces `$RESEARCH_NEEDED` and `$RESEARCH_TOPICS` variables.
- **Step 11 (Spawn Researcher):** Conditional step that spawns the `phase-researcher` custom agent inline when research is needed, following the same Task tool pattern as `/research-phase`. Writes RESEARCH.md to the feedback subphase directory. Handles RESEARCH BLOCKED gracefully without stopping the feedback flow.
- **Step 12 (modified planner prompt):** The planner agent now receives research findings as a conditional block between execution context and project context sections.
- **Planner guide updates:** `planner-feedback-mode.md` documents RESEARCH.md as an optional input, updates the comparison table, and adds the "Research informs, feedback decides" principle.
- **Quick Fix Path untouched:** Step 6 remains completely unchanged.
