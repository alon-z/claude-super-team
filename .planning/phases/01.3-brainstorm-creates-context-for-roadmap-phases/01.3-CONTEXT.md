# Context for Phase 1.3: Brainstorm creates CONTEXT.md for phases added to roadmap

## Phase Boundary (from ROADMAP.md)

**Goal:** After brainstorm adds discussed ideas as new phases to the roadmap, also create a CONTEXT.md file for each new phase capturing the decisions already made during brainstorming

**Success Criteria:**
1. When brainstorm adds a phase to the roadmap, it also creates a CONTEXT.md in that phase's directory with the decisions from the brainstorm discussion
2. The CONTEXT.md follows the standard context template format so downstream skills (plan-phase, execute-phase) can consume it

**What's in scope for this phase:**
- Adding a new Phase 11.5 to the brainstorm SKILL.md that creates CONTEXT.md files after Phase 11 (roadmap update)
- Using the full discuss-phase context template format
- Filling in as much of the template as brainstorm data allows (phase boundary, decisions, deferred ideas, codebase context if mapped)

**What's explicitly out of scope:**
- Changing the brainstorm discussion flow itself
- Modifying the create-roadmap skill
- Changing the discuss-phase context template

## Implementation Decisions

### Hook Point

**Decision:** New Phase 11.5 after Phase 11 (create-roadmap), not embedded inside Phase 11

**Rationale:** Clean separation of concerns -- Phase 11 handles roadmap creation via /create-roadmap invocation, Phase 11.5 handles CONTEXT.md generation. This keeps the roadmap skill unaware of context files.

**Constraints:** Phase 11.5 must run only when Phase 11 actually created new phases (i.e., user chose "Add to roadmap" and create-roadmap succeeded)

### Content Scope

**Decision:** Full context template -- fill in as much of the standard CONTEXT.md format as brainstorm data allows

**Rationale:** Since brainstorm already has rich discussion data (scope, tradeoffs, decisions, codebase context if mapped), we should populate the full template rather than a subset. This means plan-phase and discuss-phase can skip redundant work.

**Constraints:** Must use the discuss-phase context template structure (assets/context-template.md) so downstream skills recognize the format. Sections where brainstorm has no data should be noted as "Not available from brainstorm session" rather than omitted.

## Claude's Discretion

- How to map brainstorm idea decisions (approve/defer/reject + discussion answers) into the context template's "Implementation Decisions" format
- Whether to reference the discuss-phase template by reading it at runtime or embedding the structure inline in the skill

---

## Deferred Ideas

- Having brainstorm auto-invoke /discuss-phase for deeper gray-area exploration on approved ideas (too much scope creep for a quick phase)
