# Phase 01.3 Plan 01: Add Phase 11.5 to brainstorm SKILL.md Summary

Added a new phase (Phase 12: Generate Context Files for New Phases) to the brainstorm skill that creates CONTEXT.md files for each phase added to the roadmap during brainstorming, using the standard discuss-phase context template format.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files | Status |
|---|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Add Phase 11.5 to brainstorm SKILL.md for CONTEXT.md generation | d028972 | plugins/claude-super-team/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md | complete |

## What Was Built

- New Phase 12 in brainstorm SKILL.md that runs after Phase 11 (roadmap update) only when /create-roadmap actually created new phases
- Reads the discuss-phase context template at runtime for forward compatibility
- Maps brainstorm discussion data into all template sections (Phase Boundary, Codebase Context, Cross-Phase Dependencies, Implementation Decisions, Claude's Discretion, Specific Ideas, Deferred Ideas, Examples)
- Handles both interactive and autonomous mode data sources
- Uses "Not available from brainstorm session" fallback for empty sections
- Updated Phase 13 (formerly Phase 12) summary output to include context file paths
- Updated success criteria checklist with context file generation

## Deviations From Plan

None.

## Decisions Made

- Code simplifier renumbered Phase 11.5 to Phase 12 and old Phase 12 to Phase 13 for sequential consistency within the skill file. The "11.5" naming was a planning convention; the skill itself reads better with sequential numbers.

## Issues / Blockers

None.
