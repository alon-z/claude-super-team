# Phase 1.2 Plan 01: Branch Guard and Team Mode Logging Summary

Added a branch guard (Phase 1.5) and execution mode decision logging (Phase 2.5) to the execute-phase skill, with per-wave single-plan downgrade notes and mode reporting in the completion summary.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files | Status |
|---|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Add branch guard between Phase 1 and Phase 2 | d4640bf | plugins/claude-super-team/skills/execute-phase/SKILL.md | complete |
| 2 | Add team mode decision logging after execution mode detection | 152efcf | plugins/claude-super-team/skills/execute-phase/SKILL.md | complete |

## What Was Built

- **Phase 1.5 (Branch Guard):** Detects current branch via `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. Warns on main/master via AskUserQuestion with "Switch branch" or "Continue anyway" options. Prints a simple note for detached HEAD or missing git.
- **Phase 2.5 (Log Execution Mode Decision):** Prints one of three messages based on how EXEC_MODE was determined (--team flag, env var, or default task mode), including instructions on how to change the setting.
- **Phase 5 single-plan downgrade:** Per-wave note that downgrades teams to task mode when a wave has only a single plan.
- **Phase 9 summary:** Added execution mode line and Mode column to the wave summary table.
