# Phase 01.7 Plan 01: Simplifier Toggle Summary

Added a per-project `simplifier` preference to STATE.md that gates the code-simplifier step in execute-phase for both task mode and teams mode.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files | Status |
|---|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Add simplifier preference reading and gate both invocation sites | 836041a | plugins/claude-super-team/skills/execute-phase/SKILL.md | complete |
| 2 | Add simplifier preference to STATE.md | dc4f969 | .planning/STATE.md | complete |

## What Was Built

- **Phase 3.6** in execute-phase SKILL.md: reads `simplifier` from STATE.md Preferences, defaults to `enabled` if missing
- **Phase 5e conditional**: task mode simplifier call gated by `$SIMPLIFIER_PREF`
- **Phase 5c conditional**: teams mode teammate prompt simplifier instruction gated by `$SIMPLIFIER_PREF`
- **STATE.md**: `simplifier: enabled` added to Preferences section as the default
- **Flow line** updated to reflect conditional: "simplify code (if enabled)"

## Deviations From Plan

None.

## Decisions Made

- When `simplifier` preference is not found in STATE.md, default to `enabled` silently (no AskUserQuestion prompt). This follows the plan's "silent default" specification and differs from execution-model which prompts the user.

## Issues / Blockers

None.
