# Phase 1.7 Context: Simplifier Toggle

## Phase Boundary

**In scope:** Add a per-project toggle to disable the code-simplifier agent step in execute-phase
**Out of scope:** Changing the simplifier agent itself, adding per-plan granularity, CLI flags

## Implementation Decisions

### Config Location
**Decision:** STATE.md under `## Preferences`, following the existing `execution-model` pattern.
**Format:** `simplifier: enabled` or `simplifier: disabled`
**Rationale:** Consistent with how execution-model is already stored. Per-project, persists across sessions, easy to edit.

### Initial Value
**Decision:** Default to enabled (current behavior). No prompt during execution.
**Rationale:** Existing projects continue to work unchanged. Users who want to disable it manually set `simplifier: disabled` in STATE.md preferences.

## Claude's Discretion

- How to read and check the preference in the SKILL.md logic (implementation detail)
- Exact wording of the log message when simplifier is skipped

## Deferred Ideas

- `--no-simplify` CLI flag for one-off disabling (could be added later if needed)
- Per-plan `simplifier: false` frontmatter field for granular control
