# Phase 01.6 Plan 01: Progress Sync Detection Summary

Added planning file sync detection to the /progress skill and documented the capability in cst-help references.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files | Status |
|---|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Add sync detection phase to progress SKILL.md | bb16d79 | progress/SKILL.md | complete |
| 2 | Update cst-help skill reference and documentation | 1502cd8 | cst-help/SKILL.md, troubleshooting.md, workflow-guide.md | complete |

## What Was Built

- **Phase 2: Detect Planning File Sync Issues** -- new phase inserted into /progress between structure verification and context loading. Performs three checks: directory vs roadmap mismatches, STATE.md drift, and progress table inconsistencies.
- **Sync Issues output block** -- conditional "### Sync Issues" section appears in the progress report before the phase table when issues are found, omitted when clean.
- **cst-help updates** -- skill reference mentions sync detection, troubleshooting guide has a new entry for sync issues, workflow guide documents sync detection in the pipeline overview, state tracking, and "When Lost or Returning" sections.
