# Phase 01.6 Verification: Progress Sync Detection

## Must-Haves

1. /progress includes a sync detection step that runs before the status report and detects all three categories of mismatches
2. /progress outputs a prominent warning block at the top of the report when sync issues are found, and omits it entirely when no issues exist

## Artifact Verification

### plugins/claude-super-team/skills/progress/SKILL.md

**Level 1 -- Existence:** EXISTS (413 lines)
**Level 2 -- Substantive:** SUBSTANTIVE -- Phase 2 (lines 55-104) implements all three sync checks with bash examples and reporting logic
**Level 3 -- Wired:** WIRED -- Phase 2 feeds into Phase 7 output; sync issues block appears in report template

### plugins/claude-super-team/skills/cst-help/SKILL.md

**Level 1 -- Existence:** EXISTS (485 lines)
**Level 2 -- Substantive:** SUBSTANTIVE -- /progress skill reference updated (line 387) to mention sync issue detection
**Level 3 -- Wired:** WIRED -- references sync detection in skill description

### plugins/claude-super-team/skills/cst-help/references/troubleshooting.md

**Level 1 -- Existence:** EXISTS (488 lines)
**Level 2 -- Substantive:** SUBSTANTIVE -- New section "/progress shows sync issues" (lines 196-206) with symptom, solution, and specific fix guidance for each sync issue type. "When to Use Each Skill" updated for /progress (line 399).
**Level 3 -- Wired:** WIRED -- troubleshooting entry covers all sync issue categories (orphan directories, missing directories, STATE.md drift, progress table issues)

### plugins/claude-super-team/skills/cst-help/references/workflow-guide.md

**Level 1 -- Existence:** EXISTS (317 lines)
**Level 2 -- Substantive:** SUBSTANTIVE -- Pipeline overview updated (line 19), State Tracking section updated (line 68), "When Lost or Returning" pattern updated (line 180)
**Level 3 -- Wired:** WIRED -- workflow guide reflects sync detection as a core /progress capability

## Observable Truths

### 1. Sync detection runs before status report with all three check categories
**Status:** VERIFIED

Phase 2 (lines 55-104) implements three checks:
- **Check 1: Directory vs Roadmap** (lines 59-74) -- compares phase directories against ROADMAP.md entries, reports orphan directories and missing directories
- **Check 2: STATE.md Drift** (lines 76-86) -- extracts current phase from STATE.md, verifies it exists in ROADMAP.md and has a directory
- **Check 3: Progress Table Inconsistencies** (lines 88-103) -- compares Progress table entries against Phases checklist

Phase 2 runs after Phase 1 (structure verification) and before Phase 3 (context loading), which is before Phase 7 (status report).

### 2. Prominent warning block shown when issues found, omitted when clean
**Status:** VERIFIED

Phase 7 template (lines 206-213) includes a "### Sync Issues" block with example warnings. Line 236 explicitly states: "Sync Issues block: Only show if Phase 2 found issues. Omit entirely when clean." The block appears between the progress bar header and the phases table, making it prominent.

### 3. cst-help documentation updated
**Status:** VERIFIED

- cst-help SKILL.md line 387: "/progress ... Detects sync issues between phase directories, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, and progress table"
- troubleshooting.md lines 196-206: New "/progress shows sync issues" entry with resolution steps
- troubleshooting.md line 399: "When to Use /progress" updated with sync detection use case
- workflow-guide.md line 19: Pipeline shows "Detect sync issues"
- workflow-guide.md line 68: State Tracking section mentions sync detection
- workflow-guide.md line 180: "When Lost or Returning" pattern mentions sync detection

## Anti-Pattern Scan

| Pattern | Found | Severity |
|---------|-------|----------|
| TODO/FIXME | No | -- |
| Placeholder content | No | -- |
| Empty implementations | No | -- |
| Stub patterns | No | -- |

## Result

**Status: passed**

Both must-haves verified. The sync detection step covers all three categories (directory vs roadmap, STATE.md drift, progress table inconsistencies), runs before the status report, and the warning block is conditional -- shown prominently when issues exist, omitted entirely when clean. All four documentation artifacts are updated consistently.
