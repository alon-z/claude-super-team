# Phase 1.4 Plan 01: Add Compaction Resilience to Execute-Phase Summary

Skill-scoped PreCompact and SessionStart(compact) hooks added to execute-phase frontmatter, with EXEC-PROGRESS.md tracking throughout the execution flow and cst-help documentation updated.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files | Status |
|---|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Add hooks and EXEC-PROGRESS.md tracking | a14ac78 | execute-phase/SKILL.md | complete |
| 2 | Update cst-help with compaction docs | ad28cd7 | cst-help/SKILL.md, workflow-guide.md, troubleshooting.md | complete |

## What Was Built

- **Hooks in execute-phase frontmatter**: PreCompact hook (matcher: "auto") outputs EXEC-PROGRESS.md content during compaction. SessionStart hook (matcher: "compact") re-injects STATE.md, PROJECT.md, EXEC-PROGRESS.md, and all PLAN.md files for the current phase after compaction.
- **EXEC-PROGRESS.md tracking**: Phase 4.7 initializes the progress file with wave/plan structure, team name, and teammate assignments. Update instructions at 5 points: wave start, teammate spawn, plan completion, wave completion, and team cleanup.
- **Resumption section updated**: Notes that hooks re-inject EXEC-PROGRESS.md after compaction for finer-grained state recovery within a wave.
- **cst-help documentation**: Skill reference updated with compaction resilience bullets. Workflow guide has new "Compaction Resilience" subsection. Troubleshooting has two new entries (lost track after compaction, configure threshold). "When to Use" section updated.
